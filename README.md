## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- 98% in HTML + CSS
- Stylus + CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

We need to think about what is available around, before start looking out of the box.

Basically with elements closest to mine I can perform a specific CSS that can achieve my goal.
